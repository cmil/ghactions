\section{Docker}{

This action \strong{requires a Docker image called \emph{literally} \code{repo:latest} in \code{github/workspace}.}
See \href{https://www.maxheld.de/ghactions/articles/ghactions.html}{vignette} for details.
Use \code{\link[=build_image]{build_image()}} to create one in a prior action.

This action or workflow requires that you \emph{bring-your-own-dockerfile} (byod).
There has to be a \code{Dockerfile} at the root of your repository.
It's easy to set one up using \code{\link[=use_dockerfile]{use_dockerfile()}}.
To learn more, consider the \href{https://www.maxheld.de/ghactions/articles/ghactions.html}{vignette}.
