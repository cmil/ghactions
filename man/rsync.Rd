\title{Create \href{https://github.com/maxheld83/rsync/tree/v0.1.1}{rsync action} to deploy via \href{https://rsync.samba.org}{Rsync} over SSH.}
\usage{
rsync(IDENTIFIER, needs, HOST_NAME, HOST_IP, HOST_FINGERPRINT, SRC, USER,
  DEST, env = NULL, args = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{IDENTIFIER}{\code{[character(1)]}
giving the name of the action or workflow block.

Used:
\itemize{
\item as an informative label on GitHub.com,
\item in the \code{needs} fields of other \emph{action blocks} to model the workflow graph,
\item in the \code{resolves} fields of other \emph{workflow blocks} to model the workflow graph.
}}

\item{needs}{\code{[character()]}
giving the actions (by their \code{IDENTIFIER}s) that must complete successfully before this action will be invoked.
Defaults to \code{NULL} for no upstream dependencies.}

\item{HOST_NAME}{\code{[character(1)]}
giving the name of the server you wish to deploy to, such as \code{foo.example.com}.}

\item{HOST_IP}{\code{[character(1)]}
giving the IP of the server you wish to deploy to, such as \code{111.111.11.111}.}

\item{HOST_FINGERPRINT}{\code{[character(1)]}
giving the fingerprint of the server you wish to deploy to, can have different formats.}

\item{SRC}{\code{[character(1)]}
giving the source directory, relative path \emph{from} \code{/github/workspace}.}

\item{USER}{\code{[character(1)]}
giving the user at the target \code{HOST_NAME}.}

\item{DEST}{\code{[character(1)]}
giving the directory from the root of the \code{HOST_NAME} target to write to.}

\item{env}{\code{[list(character(1)]}
giving the environment variables to set in the action's runtime environment.
Defaults to \code{NULL} for no environment variables.}

\item{args}{\code{[character()]}
giving the arguments to pass to the action.
Arguments get appended to the last command in \code{ENTRYPOINT}.
Defaults to \code{NULL} for no arguments.}

\description{
\strong{Remember to provide \code{SSH_PRIVATE_KEY} and \code{SSH_PUBLIC_KEY} as secrets to the GitHub UI.}.

Thin wrapper around GitHub actions.
}
\details{
These functions are for \strong{advanced users} knowledgeable about GitHub actions.
Novice users may be better served by the complete templates in workflows.

These functions provide very thin wrappers around existing GitHub actions, including actions from other repositories.
Essentially, they just create lists ready to be ingested by \code{\link[=make_action_block]{make_action_block()}}, which then turns these R lists into valid GitHub actions syntax blocks.

For documentation on these actions, consult their respective \code{README.md}s linked in the below.
Some variants of these action wrappers include sensible defaults for frequent uses in R.

The \code{uses} field is \emph{always} hardcoded to a particular commit or tag of the underlying github action to ensure compatibility.

To render an action block completely from scratch, you can always use the templating function \code{\link[=make_action_block]{make_action_block()}}.
